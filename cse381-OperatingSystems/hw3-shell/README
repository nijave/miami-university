Our project appears to be fulling working and passes all tests

We spend roughly 16 hours
Of this, there were some issues getting memory management to work right (fixing segfaults) and we spent a while figuring out the tests weren't passing because we didn't flush stdout
In addition, we were exiting incorrectly which also caused problems

We relied primarily on snippets from Stackoverflow of other people's programs to help u understand memory management
We used this source file to help us troubleshoot the test failing issues which led us to add flushing and update how it exists: https://github.com/onemahon/General-Programming/blob/master/homework%20projects/OperatingSystems/project1/shell.c
